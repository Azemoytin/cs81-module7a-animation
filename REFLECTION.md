### What part of the code was most confusing and why?

I had to think a little bit about how the `index` was used, but then I realized it helps the animation loop through the frames without going out of range. Once I saw how it worked, it made sense.

### How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?

The animation helped me understand how `setInterval()` works because the code still runs in the background while the rest of the page stays normal.

### What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?

I added comments to explain what the code does to make it easier to understand. I also added a creative idea in the comments to change the background for a visual effect when the loop finishes.
